Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment\u2019s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income (loss). A segment\u2019s operating income (loss) includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses\u00a0 fiscal 2019 and the $13.5 million one-time employee bonus paid to full-time, non-executive employees during fiscal 2018 due to the Company's ability to access overseas cash as a result of Tax Reform (the \"one-time employee bonus\"). These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments.

The Company has applied the new revenue standard to all contracts that were entered into after adoption and to all contracts that were open as of the initial date of adoption. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard impacts the Company's net sales on an ongoing basis depending on the relative amount of revenue sold through its distributors, the change in inventory held by its distributors, and the changes in price concessions granted to its distributors. Previously, the Company deferred revenue and cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributor sold the product to their end customer. As required by the new revenue standard, the Company no longer defers revenue and cost of sales, but rather, estimates the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and records revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. Sales to non-distributor customers, under both the previous and new revenue standards, are generally recognized upon the Company\u2019s shipment of the product. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the consolidated April 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of the new revenue standard is summarized in the table of opening balance sheet adjustments below.

The change in start-up expense in any particular period relates to the stage of the start-up process in which a facility under construction is in during the period. Non-construction related expenses, such as labor, training and office-related expenses for a facility under construction are recorded as start-up expense until the facility begins operations. As a facility moves closer to actual start-up, the expenses incurred for labor, training, etc. increase. As a result, amounts classified as start-up expenses will increase period over period until the facility begins production. Once production begins, the expenses from that point forward are recorded as costs of goods sold. The decrease in stock compensation expense is the result of the number of shares earned for the performance shares granted on November 1, 2017, being lower as compared to the number of shares earned for the performance shares granted on November 1, 2016. Stock compensation is further described in \"Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 - Stock Compensation Plans.\" The increase in legal expenses is primarily attributable to our ongoing defense of the litigation described in \"Part I, Item 3.

The provisional amount was based on information\navailable at that time, including estimated tax earnings and profits from foreign investments. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we\nfinalized our transition tax calculation and recorded additional tax expense of $0.3 million. In December 2017, we also recorded a\nprovisional write-down to deferred tax assets of $0.7 million related to changes in Section 162(m), Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\nregarding deductions for excessive employee compensation. In 2018, we finalized our calculation under Section 162(m) and recorded\na tax benefit of $0.5 million. We also recorded a one-time tax benefit in December 2017 of $1.2 million from the remeasurement of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21%.

The Company has applied the new revenue standard to all contracts that were entered into after adoption and to all contracts that were open as of the initial date of adoption. The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard impacts the Company's net sales on an ongoing basis depending on the relative amount of revenue sold through its distributors, the change in inventory held by its distributors, and the changes in price concessions granted to its distributors. Previously, the Company deferred revenue and cost of sales on shipments to distributors until the distributor sold the product to their end customer. As required by the new revenue standard, the Company no longer defers revenue and cost of sales, but rather, estimates the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and records revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. Sales to non-distributor customers, under both the previous and new revenue standards, are generally recognized upon the Company\u2019s shipment of the product. The cumulative effect of the changes made to the consolidated April 1, 2018 balance sheet for the adoption of the new revenue standard is summarized in the table of opening balance sheet adjustments below.
